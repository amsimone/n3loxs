# Choice of the process:
#   1: neutral (gamma*) Drell-Yan,
#   2: charged W+ Drell-Yan,
#   3: charged W- Drell-Yan,
#   4: inclusive W+ H Higgs-strahlung production (DY-type contributions only),
#   5: inclusive W- H Higgs-strahlung production (DY-type contributions only),
#   6: inclusive five-flavor scheme Higgs production in bottom-quark fusion,
#   7: inclusive Higgs production in gluon fusion, either in the heavy top limit (HTL) or in the Born-improved HTL

# Choice of the factorization scale mu_F = xmuf*mu_F0:
#   If muf0 = -1 (or absent), the default central scale choice is used:
#     mu_F0 = Q for Drell-Yan processes
#     mu_F0 = MH+MW for the WH processes
#     mu_F0 = (MH+2*mb_pole)/4 for the bbH process
#     mu_F0 = MH/2 for the ggH process
#   Otherwise, mu_F0 = muf0 as input by the user

# Choice of the renormalization scale mu_R = xmur*mu_R0:
#   If mur0 = -1 (or absent), the default central scale choice is used:
#     mu_R0 = MH for the bbH process for Drell-Yan processes
#     mu_R0 = muF0 for all the other processes
#   Otherwise, mu_R0 = mur0 as input by the user
#   If --scale or --7point flags are used, xmur value is discarded

# Mass parameters (in GeV):
