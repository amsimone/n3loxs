# Choice of the process:
#   1: neutral (gamma*) Drell-Yan,
#   2: charged W+ Drell-Yan,
#   3: charged W- Drell-Yan,
#   4: inclusive W+ H Higgs-strahlung production (DY-type contributions only),
#   5: inclusive W- H Higgs-strahlung production (DY-type contributions only),
#   6: inclusive five-flavor scheme Higgs production in bottom-quark fusion,
#   7: inclusive Higgs production in gluon fusion, in the Born-improved heavy top limit

# Parton distribution functions:
PDFset = PDF4LHC15_nnlo_mc
PDFnum = 0

# QCD order up to which the results are presented: 0 (LO) to 3 (N3LO)
order = 3

# Collider parameters: pp (0) or ppbar (1). Hadronic energy in TeV
collider = 0
energy   = 13.0

# Invariant lepton-mass Q in GeV (only for Drell-Yan channels)
Q    = 100.0

# Choice of the factorization scale:
#   If muf_flag = 0, the default central scale choice is used:
#     mu_F0 = Q for Drell-Yan channels
#     mu_F0 = MH+MW for the WH channels
#     mu_F0 = (MH+2*mb_pole)/4 for the bbH channel
#     mu_F0 = MH/2 for the ggH channel
#   If muf_flag = 1, mu_F0 = muf0 as input by the user
#   In all cases, the final mu_F is mu_F = xmuf*mu_F0
muf_flag = 0
muf0     = 31.2725
xmuf     = 1.0

# Choice of the renormalization scale:
#   If mur_flag = 0, the default central scale choice is used:
#     mu_R0 = MH for the bbH channel for Drell-Yan channels
#     mu_R0 = muF0 for all the other channels
#   If mur_flag = 1, mu_R0 = mur0 as input by the user
#   In all cases, the final mu_R is mu_R = xmur*mu_R0,
#   unless --scale or --7point flags are used (xmur in those cases is discarded)
mur_flag = 0
mur0     = 31.2725
xmur     = 1.0

# Mass parameters (in GeV):
#   W boson mass, W boson decay width,
#   Z boson mass, Higgs boson mass, top-quark pole mass, bottom-quark pole mass,
#   top-quark MSbar mass, bottom-quark MSbar mass, vacuum expectation value, EM constant
