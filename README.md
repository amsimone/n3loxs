# n3loxs
N3LO cross sections calculator

A tool suite to calculate up to N3LO in QCD various cross sections at hadron colliders:

* Neutral Drell-Yan p p(pbar) --> gamma* + X --> l+ l- + X 
* Charged Drell-Yan p p(pbar) --> W+/W- + X --> l+ nu_l / l- ~nu_l + X 
* Higgsstrahlung p p(pbar) --> W+/W- H + X 
* Higgs production via gluon fusion g g --> H + X 
* Bottom-quark fusion Higgs production b bbar --> H + X

## Installation

Prerequisites:
* A C++11 compatible C++ compiler.
* (At the moment) GNU Scientific Library (gsl) version 2.6 or higher. Later the code will be upgrated to include it.
* LHAPDF library installed on your computer.

To compile: to be done.

## Usage

to be done.

<!---
✨ Note: ✨ right now only DY is implemented. WH is on the way (nearly done), bbH and ggH are yet to be implemented.
